// testing during the planning phase, the development phase, and at the end of development phase. 
// To support this, you need to write testable code, code that's easily testable either via manual processes or automated tools. 
// Absolute must for performing unit testing.
// SOFTWARE TESTING PROCESS
    // Test planning
    // Test analysis
    // Test design
    // Construction & verification
    // Testing cycle - usually done in a cycle, includes unit testing, system-wide testing and simple code reviews
    // Final Testing
    // Post Presentation

// When determining requirements, perform inspection - eg if req are adequate, do they address the questions at hand
// Document inspection done inbetween planning phases -  ege requirement planning, design, test plans
// iN IMPLEMENTATION Apply appropriate testing tools and do code inspection, 
// At minimium core functions must be tested

// COMMON TOOLS FOR TESTING
    // IDEs: 
        // Web matrix, Visual Studio
    // Open Source Testing Tools: 
        // Selenium, Apache JMeter
    // Windows based tools: 
        // Test Studio
